##  Explore Azure networking services

Azure virtual networks enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. You can think of an Azure network as a set of resources that links other Azure resources.

Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:

1. Isolation and segmentation
2. Internet communications
3. Communicate between Azure resources
4. Communicate with on-premises resources
5. Route network traffic
6. Filter network traffic
7. Connect virtual networks
