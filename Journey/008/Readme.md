1. class - A 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 ( large scale companies)
2. class - B 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255(small scale companies)
3. class - c 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255(for laboratory use)

These ip addresses were used in companies to make communications between resources.And there is no cost for using this ip addresses,but make sure that ip addresses are not overlapping on one another.
